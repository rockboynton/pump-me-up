## Intro

Make a dumb sanitizer smart!

Uses STM32 development board combined with a photoresistor to rotate servos to
automatically dispense a hand sanitizer from a bottle.

Check it out!

## Components and Supplies

* I used a Nucleo-F446RE STM32 microcontroller, but you can use any [mbed
compatible board](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/).

* USB type B cable

* [Photo cell (Cds photoresistor)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161)

* (3) SG90 [Servo motors](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE1_EE/stores/sg90_datasheet.pdf)

* Bread board

* Jumper wires of various length

* Dental floss

* A *lot* of tape

## Online Compiler

I used the [mbed online compiler IDE](https://ide.mbed.com/compiler/), which
allowed me to get up and running with relative ease.

In the future, I would love to check out the mbed CLI, and though.
